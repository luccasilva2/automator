    <h1>Terms of Service</h1>

    <p>
        Repost Automator enables users to upload and manage their own TikTok content 
        using the official TikTok API.
    </p>

    <h2>1. Authorized Use</h2>
    <p>
        You may only upload content to TikTok accounts that you personally own 
        and explicitly authorize through this platform.
    </p>

    <h2>2. Content Responsibility</h2>
    <p>
        You are responsible for ensuring that all uploaded content is lawful, 
        original, and compliant with TikTok policies.
    </p>

    <h2>3. API Usage</h2>
    <p>
        The application interacts exclusively with the official TikTok Content Posting API.
        No unauthorized or third-party accounts are accessed.
    </p>

    <h2>4. Token Usage</h2>
    <p>
        Access tokens are used solely to upload videos on behalf of the user 
        and are never shared with external services.
    </p>

    <h2>5. Limitations</h2>
    <p>
        We are not responsible for TikTok API downtimes, technical issues, or account restrictions.
